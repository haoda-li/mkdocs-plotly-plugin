## Credits

Inspiration for this plugin came from Tim Vink's [mkdocs-charts-plugin](https://github.com/timvink/mkdocs-charts-plugin) and Blueswen's [mkdocs-glightbox](https://github.com/blueswen/mkdocs-glightbox).

@facelessuser's excellent [https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions](pymdown-extensions) library and documentation helped making this plugin a lot easier.

And [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) is an amazing library for interactive visualizations.
